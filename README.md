## Description
   This is Project 1 of 3 in the course of our bootcamp. The project we came up with is meant to solve a real world problem is to solve D.D.D.(DoorDash Dependency). 

### User Story
As a user I want
To see a clean UI that is simple and easy to understand
So that 
I can navigate and utilize the application for it's intended use

As a user I want
To enter a desired distance away from my current location, price, type of food, rating?
So that 
The application can give me a result that matches my criteria


As a user I want
To adjust a slider that determines a radius around my current location
So that
The application knows how far i'm willing to travel for the chosen location

As a user I want
To see a responsive webpage
So that
I can view the application on different screens and devices

As a user I want
The application to choose a random restaurant within my criteria
So that
I do not have to decide where to eat

As a user I want
My recent results to be saved to local storage and placed on the page to see my past results
So that
I can see my past results that I have been given
## Executing program
Click on the "USE CURRENT LOCATION" button or use the address bar to find your address.
Scroll down to the "GENERATE YOUR DINING DESTINATION" button.
Scroll farther down to see your dining destination.
Go to the restaurant and eat or click the "GENERATE YOUR DINING DESTINATION" button again until you find something that peaks your interest.
