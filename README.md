## Description
   This is Project 1 of 3 in the course of our bootcamp. The project we came up with is meant to solve a real world problem is to solve D.D.D.(DoorDash Dependency). 

### User Story
As a user I want
To see a clean UI that is simple and easy to understand
So that 
I can navigate and utilize the application for it's intended use

As a user I want
To enter a desired distance away from my current location, price, type of food, rating?
So that 
The application can give me a result that matches my criteria


As a user I want
To adjust a slider that determines a radius around my current location
So that
The application knows how far i'm willing to travel for the chosen location

As a user I want
To see a responsive webpage
So that
I can view the application on different screens and devices

As a user I want
The application to choose a random restaurant within my criteria
So that
I do not have to decide where to eat

As a user I want
My recent results to be saved to local storage and placed on the page to see my past results
So that
I can see my past results that I have been given
## Executing program

Scroll down to the "GENERATE YOUR DINING DESTINATION" button.
Scroll farther down to see your dining destination.
