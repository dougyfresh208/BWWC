## As a user I want
### To see a clean UI that is simple and easy to understand
## So that 
### I can navigate and utilize the application for it's intended use

## As a user I want
### To enter a desired distance away from my current location, price, type of food, rating?
## So that 
### The application can give me a result that matches my criteria

## As a user I want
### To adjust a slider that determines a radius around my current location
## So that
### The application knows how far i'm willing to travel for the chosen location

## As a user I want
### To see a responsive webpage
## So that
### I can view the application on different screens and devices

## As a user I want
### The application to choose a random restaurant within my criteria
## So that
### I do not have to decide where to eat

## As a user I want
### My recent results to be saved to local storage and placed on the page to see my past results
## So that
### I can see my past results that I have been given
